# Assignment for Frontend Engineer job applicants

I skipped implementation of following an author, logic of liking an article is pretty simmilar to this. 
I also did't implement single article view - I handled data fetching in many other places in this application, so this should give You the general view of how I dealt with this. 
Repository includes test of App component.
I left couple TODOs.
